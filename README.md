## Purpose

I started this project to create a living online document of my Fiance's food sensitivities and allergies. My hope is this will help others easily share their dietary restrictions with their friends and family.

## Use

This is a static website built on Vue and Material Design Lite. The allergies listed can easily be modified in the `allergies.yml` file. This is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file which should be reasonably easy for most technically savvy people to edit.

## Hosting

After modifying `allergies.yml` upload all the files to your favorite static website hosting service. When necessary, modify the `allergies.yml` file and re-upload it.
