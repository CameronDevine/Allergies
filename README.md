## Purpose

I started this project to provide a centeral location to share my Fiance's dynamically changing food allergies and sensetivities. By sharing this tool I hope others will be able to more easily share their dietary restrictions with friends and family.

## Use

This is a static website built on [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/). The allergies listed can easily be modified in the [`allergies.yml`](allergies.yml) file. This is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file which has a simple enough syntax to be easily editable.

## Hosting

After modifying `allergies.yml`, upload all the files to your favorite static website hosting service. When necessary, modify the `allergies.yml` file and re-upload it.
